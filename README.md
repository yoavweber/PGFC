# PGFS - ParaGliding File System
This project is built as tasked in the course PROG2005 Cloud Technologies for the Spring 2021 Semester. The project is suggested to be available as open source, for further work after the project period has ended.
This application is based on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), and is intended to be used by paragliders to share flight-info with each other, completely decentralized. The application in the current state is entirely backend-focused and is written in golang.
Paraglider-flight files (in standardized format ".igc") are intended for sharing on a peer-to-peer basis.

Project Documentation can be located in the Github-wiki.
